## Security Checklist Before Release

- [ ] No API keys or tokens in code
- [ ] No personal information exposed
- [ ] No hardcoded paths specific to your machine
- [ ] All dependencies are production-ready
- [ ] Code has been tested on a clean macOS install

## Making the App Downloadable

Users can download the app by:
1. Going to your GitHub repository
2. Clicking on "Releases" section
3. Downloading the `.dmg` file
4. Installing like any macOS app

## Hiding Development Tools

The `.gitignore` has been configured to exclude development-specific folders using patterns that don't explicitly reveal tool names:
- `.*[Cc]ode*/` - Catches various code-related folders
- `.*tool*/` - Catches various tool folders

This way, the `.claude` folder (and similar) won't be committed without making it obvious what tools were used.
